# Personal Skill Tree Builderüå≥
A Python-based tool to visually map and navigate your comprehensive knowledge landscape. This project helps combat knowledge dispersion by creating a macro-level "skill tree" or "knowledge graph," allowing you to see the relationships between broad domains and key concepts at a glance.

## üí° Why This Tool?

As polymaths and lifelong learners, we may accumulate vast amounts of knowledge across diverse fields like Mathematics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Languages. A common challenge is that this knowledge can become "discrete" ‚Äì we know we've learned something but struggle to recall details or their connections to other concepts, especially if rarely used.

This tool addresses that by:

*   **Providing a Macro View:** Instead of atomized notes (which are still valuable for depth), it focuses on the high-level relationships between broad topics and major concepts.
*   **Enhancing Recall & Navigation:** By visualizing how concepts connect, you can quickly locate where a specific piece of knowledge fits into your overall understanding and how it relates to other fields.
*   **Identifying Gaps & Strengths:** See which areas are densely connected (your strengths) and which are isolated (potential areas for deeper integration or review).
*   **Facilitating Cross-Domain Thinking:** Encourage discovering analogies and foundational principles that span multiple disciplines.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Simple Data Input:** Define your knowledge concepts and their relationships using an intuitive `source -> target` text file format.
*   **Graph Construction:** Utilizes the `networkx` library to build a directed graph representing your knowledge connections.
*   **Interactive Visual Representation:** Generates a clear, customizable, and **interactive** HTML visualization of your skill tree using `pyvis` (built on `vis.js`), allowing you to zoom, pan, and drag nodes.
*   **Basic Graph Analysis:** Provides insights into your knowledge structure, such as total nodes/edges, highly connected concepts (high in-degree), and major branch points (high out-degree).
*   **Terminal Exploration:** Allows you to query the graph from the terminal to see direct predecessors and successors of any concept.
*   **GEXF Export:** Capability to export the graph data in GEXF format, allowing for advanced analysis and more sophisticated static visualizations in tools like [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Miki-Riako/Personal-Skill-Tree-Builder.git
    cd Personal-Skill-Tree-Builder
    ```

2.  **Install required Python libraries:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file as described below.)*

### Usage

1.  **Create `requirements.txt` (if not already present):**
    Before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`, ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the project root with the following content:

    ```txt
    networkx
    matplotlib # Optional, if you decide to use it for other static plots
    pyvis
    ```

2.  **Define Your Knowledge Relations:**
    Create a file named `relations.txt` in the root directory of the project. In this file, list your knowledge concepts and their relationships. Each line should represent a single relationship in the format `Source_Concept -> Target_Concept`.

    **Example `relations.txt`:**

    ```txt
    # This is your knowledge relations definition file.
    # Use 'Source_Concept -> Target_Concept' format for each relationship.
    # Lines starting with '#' are comments and will be ignored.

    # Top-level Domains
    Mathematics -> Calculus
    Mathematics -> Linear_Algebra
    CS -> Algorithms
    CS -> Operating_Systems
    Physics -> Electromagnetism
    EE -> Circuits

    # Cross-domain Relationships (Macro Level)
    Physics -> Mathematics
    EE -> Physics
    CS -> Mathematics
    Machine_Learning -> Linear_Algebra # ML depends on Linear Algebra

    # In-domain Refinements (still macro/key concepts)
    Operating_Systems -> Concurrency
    Concurrency -> Spinlock # Spinlock is a concurrency mechanism
    Spinlock -> CAS # CAS is an atomic operation used in spinlocks
    Electromagnetism -> Maxwell_Equations # Maxwell's Equations are central to Electromagnetism
    Calculus -> Consistent_Continuity # Consistent Continuity is a concept in Calculus
    ```

    **Tip:** Start with broad domains and their high-level connections first. Gradually add more specific, but still important, concepts as you refine your map.

3.  **Run the Script:**

    Execute the main script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    This will:
    *   Load your `relations.txt` file.
    *   Print some basic graph statistics to the terminal.
    *   Generate an interactive HTML visualization of your knowledge graph (`skill_tree.html`) in the project root. Open this file in any web browser to explore your graph!
    *   Export the graph data to a GEXF file (`skill_tree.gexf`) for advanced analysis in tools like Gephi.
    *   Prompt you to enter a concept to explore its direct connections within the graph via the terminal.

<!-- **Interactive HTML Visualization (`skill_tree.html`):**

(Imagine a screenshot or GIF here of an interactive graph in a browser, where you can zoom, pan, and drag nodes. You'll generate this once the `pyvis` issue is resolved!)
You can see nodes representing concepts, and arrows showing relationships. Top-level domains (like CS, Mathematics) might be larger or differently colored, indicating their foundational nature. You can click on nodes to select them, and drag them around to explore connections. -->

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Enhancements

This project is a starting point and can be extended in many exciting ways:

*   **More Sophisticated Data Input:**
    *   Support for YAML or JSON files to allow richer node and edge attributes (e.g., `skill_level`, `last_reviewed_date`, `relationship_type` like `IS_A`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `APPLIES_TO`).
*   **Advanced Graph Analysis:**
    *   Implement algorithms for community detection (identifying clusters of related knowledge), shortest path finding between concepts, or centrality measures (identifying most influential concepts).
*   **Different Layout Algorithms:**
    *   Further explore and implement other `vis.js` or `Graphviz` layout options to find the most aesthetically pleasing and informative representation for complex graphs.
*   **Integration with PKM Tools:**
    *   Scripts to convert knowledge graph data to formats compatible with Obsidian MOCs (Maps of Content), or to generate Anki flashcards for concepts you want to actively recall.
*   **GUI or Web Interface:**
    *   Develop a simple graphical user interface or a lightweight web application for easier data input and graph viewing, beyond just the generated HTML.
