# This file defines your personal knowledge graph.
# It consists of 'nodes' (concepts/skills) and 'edges' (relationships between them).
#
# --- NODES (Concepts/Skills) ---
# Each node has a unique 'id' (used for internal linking) and a 'label' (what's displayed).
# You can add any custom attributes to nodes (e.g., 'level', 'description', 'tags', 'last_reviewed').

# --- EDGES (Relationships between Concepts) ---
# Each edge must specify 'source' and 'target' nodes by their 'id'.
# You can add any custom attributes to edges (e.g., 'type', 'strength', 'notes').
# 'type' is particularly useful for categorizing relationships (e.g., DEPENDS_ON, HAS_SUBFIELD).
